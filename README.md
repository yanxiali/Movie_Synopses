# Movie_Synopses
In this project, I use unsupervised learning models to cluster unlabeled documents into different groups, visualize the results and identify their latent topics/structures.

**Data**:
A list of the 100 movies and their synopses from IMDB and Wikipedia are [here](https://github.com/yanxiali/Movie_Synopses/tree/master/input)

Please check out the results [here](https://github.com/yanxiali/Movie_Synopses/blob/master/Movie-Synopses.ipynb)
